# 📚 Documentation in dbt

Documentation is one of dbt's most powerful features, allowing you to create rich, interactive documentation for your data transformation pipeline. This section covers everything you need to know about documenting your dbt project effectively.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- ✅ **YAML Configuration**: How to configure models, sources, and tests
- ✅ **Markdown Documentation**: Writing rich descriptions with formatting
- ✅ **References and Links**: Connecting documentation across your project
- ✅ **dbt docs generate**: Creating interactive documentation sites
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Industry standards for data documentation

## 📖 Documentation Topics

### 1. [YAML Configuration](yaml-configuration.md)
Learn how to configure your dbt resources using YAML files:
- Model properties and descriptions
- Source configurations
- Test definitions
- Column-level documentation

### 2. [Markdown Documentation](markdown-docs.md)
Master writing rich documentation with Markdown:
- Formatting text and code blocks
- Adding images and links
- Using dbt Jinja in docs
- Cross-referencing models and sources

### 3. [Interactive Documentation](interactive-docs.md)
Generate and customize dbt's interactive documentation:
- Using `dbt docs generate`
- Serving documentation locally
- Customizing the docs site
- Deploying documentation

## 🌟 Why Documentation Matters

Good documentation in dbt serves multiple purposes:

- **📋 Data Catalog**: Acts as a searchable catalog of all your data assets
- **🔍 Data Lineage**: Shows how data flows through your transformations
- **👥 Team Collaboration**: Helps team members understand data models
- **📊 Business Context**: Explains the business meaning of metrics and dimensions
- **🔧 Maintenance**: Makes it easier to maintain and update models
- **📈 Data Quality**: Documents assumptions and business rules

## 🚀 Quick Start

Let's start with a simple example. In your `models` directory, create a YAML file:

```yaml
# models/staging/schema.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_customers
    description: "Cleaned and standardized customer data"
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: "Unique identifier for customers"
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      
      - name: first_name
        description: "Customer's first name"
        
      - name: email
        description: "Customer's email address"
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```

Then generate documentation:

```bash
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

## 🎨 Documentation Best Practices

1. **📝 Be Descriptive**: Write clear, concise descriptions
2. **🔄 Keep Updated**: Documentation should evolve with your code
3. **🎯 Business Context**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. **📊 Include Examples**: Show sample data when helpful
5. **🔗 Use References**: Link related models and sources
6. **✅ Document Tests**: Explain what quality checks you're performing

## 📋 Example Documentation Structure

```
```
```
models/
├── staging/     # Data cleaning and standardization
│   ├── staging.yml     # Source and staging model docs
├── marts/       # Business logic and dimensional modeling  
│   ├── marts.yml     # Mart model documentation
└── analytics/   # Final business-ready datasets
│   ├── analytics.yml  # Analytical model documentation
seeds/
└── jaffle-data/
    └── seeds.yml     # Generated CSV files documentation
```
```
